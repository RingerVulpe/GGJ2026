  requestText: 'Greetings Faceilitator, let us get underway. I must meet with my
    family before the festivities commence.


    I have worked really hard to get
    where I''m at, and content with my lot in life. My Face should reflect that,
    and grant me the strength this year to maintain all that I''ve worked for. As
    you have no doubt deduced, I am not very social. I rather just spend time with
    my family, so if you could keep that in mind that would be great.  '

    I bid you
    a good day, and hope you find your own strength to help the others lined up outside.'
  responsePartial: 'Hmmn. Yes this will be fine. Not perfect, but good enough.


    I
    bid you a good day, and hope you find your own strength to help the others lined
    up outside.'
  responseCorrect: 'Yes. Yes this is it. I can feel the strength from this face.
    Stoic, but fierce. It''s perfect.


    I bid you a good day, and hope you find
    your own strength to help the others lined up outside.'
