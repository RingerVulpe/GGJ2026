  requestText: 'Hi there... um... It''s my first time here at the festival... I really
    hope you can help me find a good face...


    I guess I''m still really trying
    to figure out who I am, so I don''t really know what I can tell you about myself.
    Since it''s my first time, I think I just want to watch others here and really
    spend some time this year just trying to discover myself and who I want to be.
    I''m really sorry that''s not a lot to go on!'

  responseIncorrect: 'A-are you sure? This doesn''t feel right to me... are people
    going to get the wrong impression of me?


    Oh, guess I better get going before
    I miss the festival. I don''t want to keep your line waiting, looks like you
    still have a couple more to go. Good luck Faceilitator!'
  responsePartial: "Oh thank you, I'm still a little nervous but... I think this
    face will be helpful, even if I don't feel 100% comfortable in it yet. \n\nOh,

    line waiting, looks like you still have a couple more to go. Good luck Faceilitator!"
  responseCorrect: 'Ohh. Ooooh wow... this feels really right for me! I don''t know
    how you did it, but this face really feels like it captures the essence of where
    I am in life... I feel so much more comfortable now. Thank you so much!
