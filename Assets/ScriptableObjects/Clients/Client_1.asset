  requestText: "Hey Faceilitator! Thanks for taking over for me, I hope you are up
    to the challenge! Don't worry, my request is going to be super easy, I know exactly
    what I'm looking for. \n\nThink of this as a test! Remember to check your Book
    of Faces and you'll find exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nThis year I want to
    make a lot of new friends. I want others to know that I'm very outgoing and up
    for all kinds of new adventures. Should be pretty easy to find a Face that fits
    exactly what I want others to see!"

  responseIncorrect: 'Ohhh...well it''s a lovely Face, but it''s not quite what I
    was looking for. I''m not sure others would be able to see the real me.


    You''ve
    got quite a line building outside, but hang in there! I''m sure so long as you
    get familiar with your Book of Faces you''ll find the perfect fit for everyone.
    Good luck!'
  responsePartial: 'Nice! Not exactly what I was looking for but this should still
    do nicely, thank you! This will really help others get a sense of who I am.


    You''ve
    got quite a line building outside, but hang in there! I''m sure so long as you
    get familiar with your Book of Faces you''ll find the perfect fit for everyone.
    Good luck!'
  responseCorrect: 'Whoa!! What a perfect Face, you really know what you''re doing!
    It''s like you really understand who I am. I''m going to make so many friends
    with Face like this!


    You''ve got quite a line building outside, but hang
    in there! I''m sure so long as you get familiar with your Book of Faces you''ll
    find the perfect fit for everyone. Good luck!'
